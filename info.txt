It was a few days before Christmas, 1943, and the Allied bombing campaign in
Germany was going at full throttle. Second Lieutenant Charlie Brown (great
name!) was a freshly minted bomber pilot, and he and his crew were about to
embark upon their first mission — to hit an aircraft factory in northern Germany.
As his plane named “Ye Old Pub” approached Bremen, Germany, German anti-
aircraft guns opened up on his plane. Unfortunately for the pilots and crew of Ye
Olde Pub, one of the anti-aircraft rounds exploded right in front of their plane,
destroying the number two engine and damaging number four. Missing one
engine and with another throttled back due to damage, Ye Olde Pub could no
longer keep up with the formation. They came under attack from dozens of Nazi
fighters….they fell further behind. More damage….the nose of the plane was
blown-off. Many of the crew were wounded. The plane had holes all over it-some
as big as watermelons. Only two .50 Calibre machine guns were working on the
plane (for protection).
The plane started slowly descending from the sky-major engine loss of
power….after nearly blacking-out from the plane’s oxygen supply system failing,
finally Commander Brown gained control, and starting limping the bomber back
to England.
When it looked like all hope was lost, he looked over and saw a German fighter
plane right next to him!! The German pilot was actually trying to signal him, and
attempting to get his attention. He was giving hand directions &amp; signals.
The German pilot stayed with him for a while, following Commander Brown along
the way. When the German pilot realized the B17 may actually make it back to
England, he veered off and headed back to German airspace……the B17 pilot was
perplexed for years by the German fighter pilot’s odd behavior. (By the way, the
heavily damaged B17 made it back to friendly territory-Britain.)
Hypothesize as to why the German pilot didn’t blow his plane out of the sky?!?
