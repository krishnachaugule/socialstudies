                Doris Miller was a man aboard the USS west Virginia when the attack took place. He immediately reported to duty, and helped the wounded captain to safety. He then used a machine gun to fight off the attack until he was out of ammunition. As the ship was being succumbed by the water, Miller also helped save innumerable lives, thus earning a Navy Cross which was awarded to him the following year.
