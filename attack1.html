                The purpose of this attack was to destroy and damage as much of the U.S. Pacific Fleet as much as possible, before it could reply to Japanese operations taking place on the same day against British, Dutch and US territories. In the first five minutes of the attck, four battle ships had already been hit. This attack was the opening for the United States of America in the Second World War. The sole purpose of Pearl Harbor being attacked was that the Germans knew that we would be against them in the Second world war, so they thought that it was essential to attack the only navy base in the Pacific at the time.
